sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort is the fastest out of the 3 sorts in the best possible sceneario, by running sorted50000.txt, sort1 has the fastest time and hence it is bubble sort
comparing reversed50000.txt with sort1 and sort3, sort1 takes about 1/2 time of sort3, as bubble sort compares 2 values at once compared to selection sort which only uses one.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: merge sort, compared to selection sort is fast as (n log n) is faster is than (n^2), by comparing the worst case sceneario (reserved50000.txt), sort2 is faster than sort3, hence it is using merge sort

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort is slowest, even in the most ideal scenario. As it runs the slowest the even when the file is sorted (sorted50000.txt), sort3 is selection sort.
