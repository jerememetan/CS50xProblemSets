1. I can get the aura by getting the average value of the valence, energy and danceabilityof his/her top
100 list, and based on the value roughly guage the audio aura the person prefers

2. Instead of getting the average aura in only the top 100 songs, it would be more ideal if you can get
the average aura of the person's playlists, as people tend to play different groups of music dependant on
the mood they are facing currently, usually set in a group like a playlist
